# Sustainability Outcome Measurement Software
A data capture tool for configuring and capturing sustainable outcomes

## Task Context
- A 4-person, 8-week group project undertaken in semester 1 of our MSc. Software Engineering course
- Application requirements were drawn from interactions with a 'real life' client
- Agile methodologies were heavily emphasised throughout

## Application Context
- Application was designd to be used by 'service providers/organisations' with the aim of creating events that can be measured through customizable sustainability metrics
- Application integrated with a 'user'-level application whereby users could partake in events provided and measure the outputs, regarding the sustainability metrics
- Analysis of data would resultantly identify organisations whom perfromed strongly in terms of sustainability and could potentially be subject to increased funding from various companies/NGO's/government bodies

## Individual Contribution
- I contributed heavily to the admin functionality which includes: admin home page, messaging service, creating events, editing events
- examples of these pages can be found in the screenshots/ folder
- I also contributed to: secure login functionality, service provider inbox and creating/customizing events as a service provider

## Running Application
- Spring Boot / gradle-6.7.1 Application
